Name:

Andrew Fidler

Age:

23

Race/Class:

Orc, Warlock. Changes a lot, due to min maxing DPS.

When/Why did you start, breaks?

Started during freshman year of college. Friend got him to run around killing random shit. Both went out to by the game. Was really bad while leveling up. Longest break was during ToT, came back for SoO.

Why do you continue to play:

Up until WoD logging of because of the people. Social aspects. Waiting for WoD, because it looks like a lot of fun. Was very addicted to the game for a few years. Everyone's had that stage. Might leave a group that you played with for a long time. For the first year learning about the game, and understanding what it's like. Professional hardcore gaming has ruined the game a bit. Everything is about being perfect. Rankings. Now I'm enjoying taking things a little less seriously. Nothing beats a top 5 world kill.

Near 500 days played.
Currently about 12 hours a week,
On average about 2 hours a day, after WoD comes out, starting at about 5 hours a day. Going in cycles as things are released.

How many guild have you been in.

Vodka, as a trial. 11 or 12.

What do you get the most out of wow guilds.

The uniform goal of trying to accomplish one goal. Everyone is focused on that goal. The communal goal, teamwork. The relationships are great, these are people you end up sharing numbers with... etc.
