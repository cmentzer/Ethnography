Why/When Start

Started in summer of 2008, with friends. Went to iraq, still "kinda" raided, but
it was harder, and less progressed. Took a break for ToT.


Why do you play;

This is my competitive sport. After high school, this is the colmetitve game. It
gives me something to say I'm good at. Fills the comeitve need.

What are your goals:

Kill all the content, be competitive with the DPS, and play with firends. Both
RL friends, and people you meet along the way. Need to like all the people,
something not every guild has. Even the best top 100 are sometimes very shitty
environments, I don't want it to feel like work.

Inside Guild: 8 hours a week
Outside Guild: Around 80 hours a week. "unhealthy" lol.
Days played: 500 days played

How many guilds:

About 5, lead in WotLK, then in Cata played with the same people. bounced around
for a little bit before finding PS. Then also concurently lead a guild on Blackrock.

What do you get the most out of guild:

Get to play with about 24 other people who you like, and get to know thier personallities.
Meeting people who you would normally never meet.
