Race/Class:

(currently) Troll Mage, would rather play a BE. Plays because ranged DPS has the least responsibility. BE look cute, but plays an ugly troll because trolls bring more damage in raid.

Why and when did you start playing:

Started in BC. Took a break in DS, because the game felt too easy. Didn't like the casual direction of the game. Came back shortly after MoP launched.

Why do you play:

Community of the raid Guild. One part is the mechanics of the raids. Loves the 20+ player organization, while still being competitive. Like a sports club.

How much do you play:

Raiding: about 8 hours
Preparing for raid (in game): about 2 hours
Preparing for raid (out game): about 2 hours
Grinding for stuff: 8 hours
PvP about 8 hours.

How many guilds have you been in:

5. Shortest for about 6 months, and longest for about 18 months.

What do you feel you get the most out of the guild.

The variety of characters, and large numbers of people. Even when hanging out with friends it's normally only like 5 people. In wow you get a large range of people. Some are scientists, some are teachers, some are American, some are Australian. Interesting to talk about views outside of the game.
