Introduction

Blizzard Entertainment launched World of Warcraft in late 2004, as the latest installment of the Warcraft real time strategy games from the 1990’s. The game was immediately something of a phenomenon in the gaming community, and today it is an icon of nerd and gamer culture around the world. Odds are good that you’ve heard of it. 

The authors of this paper, Nate Lilianthal and Clayton Mentzer, have been World of Warcraft players for a number of years, and between them have seen first-hand a lot of what the game has to offer. The intent of this paper is to call into question some of the stereotypes about World of Warcraft players, dispel some of the persistent misconceptions about the game and the world that it contains, and to investigate the differences between relationships that are formed in the context of WoW’s virtual space and those that are formed in the physical world. It is our belief that there is a lot of misinformation out there about World of Warcraft, the people that play WoW, and the capacity of virtual spaces to generate interpersonal relationships that are as meaningful as those created in the physical world. But first: 

What is World of Warcraft?

World of Warcraft is a massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG), or often just MMO for short. There have been a lot of MMOs that have been developed since WoW’s release, and a lot of people would argue that WoW isn’t as good as some of the newer ones. Nevertheless, WoW remains the most popular MMO on the market today, with upwards of 10 million active subscribers and 100 million different accounts created over its lifetime. In terms of man-hours, World of Warcraft players have invested nearly 6 million years of time into the game. WoW dwarfs every other MMO in terms of active player base, and while many people are just waiting for the MMO that “kills WoW”, none of them so far have gotten it quite right the way WoW has.

One of the reasons World of Warcraft has been so successful is that its roots go deep. The game draws inspiration from a myriad of sources that have all built upon one another back through the histories of gaming and fantasy, and almost all those sources have been quite successful. Perhaps one of the oldest lines that one can trace back from WoW leads to J. R.. R. Tolkien, and his The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Almost all fantasy work today draws heavily upon Tolkien’s work; which should be little surprise considering how widely loved his novels were, and are today. WoW’s lore is extremely reminiscent of Tolkien’s work: The world is filled with fantastic places and races, each of with their own histories and cultures, and all of which contain a little magic. 

By creating a world with as much depth and complexity as Tolkien’s Middle Earth, Blizzard ensured their world would be as immersive to their players as possible. Having a vast and complex world isn’t always a good thing, however. One of the common complaints about other MMOs is that the world is just too hard to get immersed in. It is too foreign or there is too much lore for a player to catch up on, or perhaps the lore is all presented to the player too quickly or too slowly. This leads us to a second reason WoW has been so successful: it built upon a franchise that the players already loved. The Warcraft Strategy games from the 1990’s had a large following prior to even the announcement of WoW, and Blizzard was able to leverage the fact that there were already characters and places and events that players of the Warcraft RTS games were familiar with when they were designing WoW. This meant that when WoW released and players loaded up the game for the first time, they already had feelings of nostalgia about the game. We know today looking at all the indie remakes of classic games how powerful the nostalgia factor can be when playing a game, and Blizzard hit metaphorical video game design gold when they decided to throw their players into a world that they had already played in, and that they were able to immediately mesh with. 

In the same way many WoW players came to the game with some pre-existing knowledge of the game’s world and lore, many WoW players came to the game with some pre-existing knowledge of the gameplay mechanics. Just as Blizzard drew heavily from fantasy sources and its own Warcraft RTS franchise when creating the world, they drew heavily from games like Baldur’s Gate and Dungeons and Dragons when designing the gameplay. Because of this, players who were already familiar with the mechanics of games like Baldur’s Gate and D&D immediately meshed with the gameplay of WoW. Your avatar in game has a race and class; an inventory; some set of skills or magical knowledge; and combat is at least partially randomized based on virtual dice rolls. The game is designed around a quest / reward system, where you complete some series of tasks for a non-player-character (a character in the game not controlled by a player, an NPC), and that NPC rewards you for your effort with some kind of loot. All of these ideas are drawn directly from Dungeons and Dragons, and by taking these ideas from D&D Blizzard brought a lot of D&D fans into WoW. With them came some of the social stigmas associated with D&D players, as well as the kind of hardcore dedicated fan that could spend 6 hours a night 3 or more days of the week playing the game.
