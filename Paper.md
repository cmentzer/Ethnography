# Living in the World of Warcraft

Blizzard Entertainment launched World of Warcraft in late 2004, as the latest installment of the Warcraft real time strategy games from the 1990’s. The game was immediately something of a phenomenon in the gaming community, and today it is an icon of nerd and gamer culture around the world. Odds are good that you’ve heard of it.

The authors of this paper, Nate Lilianthal and Clayton Mentzer, have been World of Warcraft players for a number of years, and between them have seen first-hand a lot of what the game has to offer. Clay started playing in <TODO> and has logged over <TODO> days in game with a focus on player versus player content. Nate started in 2008 and has logged over 300 days in game with a focus on player versus environment content. When it comes to analyzing content of this paper it's useful to understand the context of the authors in this light. The evidence for the paper is backed by both personal experience and interviewed experience of friends in game.

## What is World of Warcraft?

World of Warcraft is a massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG), or often just MMO for short. There have been a lot of MMOs that have been developed since WoW’s release, and a lot of people would argue that WoW isn’t as good as some of the newer ones. Nevertheless, WoW remains the most popular MMO on the market today, with upwards of 10 million active subscribers and 100 million different accounts created over its lifetime. In terms of man-hours, World of Warcraft players have invested nearly 6 million years of time into the game. WoW dwarfs every other MMO in terms of active player base, and while many people are just waiting for the MMO that “kills WoW”, none of them so far have gotten it quite right the way WoW has.

One of the reasons World of Warcraft has been so successful is that its roots go deep. The game draws inspiration from a myriad of sources that have all built upon one another back through the histories of gaming and fantasy, and almost all those sources have been quite successful. Perhaps one of the oldest lines that one can trace back from WoW leads to J. R. R. Tolkien, and his The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Almost all fantasy work today draws heavily upon Tolkien’s work; which should be little surprise considering how widely loved his novels were, and are today. WoW’s lore is extremely reminiscent of Tolkien’s work. The world is filled with fantastic places and races, each of with their own histories and cultures, and all of which contain a little magic.

By creating a world with as much depth and complexity as Tolkien’s Middle Earth, Blizzard ensured their world would be as immersive to their players as possible. Having a vast and complex world isn’t always a good thing, however. One of the common complaints about other MMOs is that the world is just too hard to get immersed in. It is too foreign or there is too much lore for a player to catch up on, or perhaps the lore is all presented to the player too quickly or too slowly. This leads us to a second reason WoW has been so successful: it built upon a franchise that the players already loved. The Warcraft Strategy games from the 1990’s had a large following prior to even the announcement of WoW, and Blizzard was able to leverage the fact that there were already characters and places and events that players of the Warcraft RTS games were familiar with when they were designing WoW. This meant that when WoW released and players loaded up the game for the first time, they already had feelings of nostalgia about the game. We know today looking at all the indie remakes of classic games how powerful the nostalgia factor can be when playing a game, and Blizzard hit metaphorical video game design gold when they decided to throw their players into a world that they had already played in, and that they were able to immediately mesh with.

In the same way many WoW players came to the game with some pre-existing knowledge of the game’s world and lore, many WoW players came to the game with some pre-existing knowledge of the gameplay mechanics. Just as Blizzard drew heavily from fantasy sources and its own Warcraft RTS franchise when creating the world, they drew heavily from games like Baldur’s Gate and Dungeons and Dragons when designing the gameplay. Because of this, players who were already familiar with the mechanics of games like Baldur’s Gate and D&D immediately meshed with the gameplay of WoW. Your avatar in game has a race and class; an inventory; some set of skills or magical knowledge; and combat is at least partially randomized based on virtual dice rolls. The game is designed around a quest / reward system, where you complete some series of tasks for a non-player-character (a character in the game not controlled by a player, an NPC), and that NPC rewards you for your effort with some kind of loot. All of these ideas are drawn directly from Dungeons and Dragons, and by taking these ideas from D&D Blizzard brought a lot of D&D fans into WoW. With them came some of the social stigmas associated with D&D players, as well as the kind of hardcore dedicated fan that could spend 6 hours a night 3 or more days of the week playing the game.

## Our Focus

The intent of this paper is to call into question some of the stereotypes about World of Warcraft players, dispel some of the persistent misconceptions about the game and the world that it contains, and to investigate the differences between relationships that are formed in the context of WoW’s virtual space and those that are formed in the physical world. It is our belief that there is a lot of misinformation out there about World of Warcraft, the people that play WoW, and the virtual spaces have the capacity to generate interpersonal relationships that are as meaningful as those created in the physical world.

# Player Interactions

Along with the mechanical aspects of the game, WoW relies heavily on players interacting with each other in a variety of ways. These interactions are the foundation of the social structures that form out of the game, and this paper. As with all social mediums, there are constraints on various forms of expression. We'll look later at how players get act within these constrains, and how they get around the limitations of the system.

WoW could be played by one's self, but the vast majority of players form connections with other players, be it just a simple "/wave" or a long term friendship. In this section we'll look at how the game does and does not facilitate these interactions.

## The Factions

There are two **main** social constructions in World of Warcraft, your faction, and your guild. While there are of course other social factors that play into the way players interact with one another, these are the most dominant ones built into the game. The reason factions play such an important role in social interaction is simple. You cannot communicate via text with members of the other faction. This leads to some interesting scenarios when one player runs into a member of the other faction. Particularly on a PvP server where players of opposing factions can directly harm one another. On these servers it is impossible for a player to engage the other player in conversation so instead, players utilize the in game emote system, which allows you to express yourself with a number of limited physical gestures. For example, it is common practice to show a player of the other faction that one means them no harm by "/waving" at them. By typing "/wave" into the chat window, a player can cause their avatar to wave at someone else. There are a number of emotes built into the game, but naturally it is impossible to use them alone to convey advanced ideas. The inability to communicate with members of the opposite faction is one of the many contributors to a general feeling of camaraderie that members of one faction share. It also contributes to negative feelings about members of the opposite faction. It is not uncommon for an Alliance player to justify "griefing" a Horde player by simply saying that they are Horde, so they deserve it. Inability to communicate cross faction makes it easier to dehumanize members of the opposite faction, and to treat them in ways that would be unacceptable in the physical world. Cross faction relationships are an interesting topic, and we will discuss it at length later in the paper.

The faction also limits your choice in guild, because you can only be in a guild with others from your faction. In that way the faction is the broadest form of social structure in game. Much of the game is played within areas (mainly cities) which are dominated by your faction. Cities have a trade chat system which, despite its name is mostly used for general communication. Trade chat is only limited to players of your faction currently in major cities, so it is usually a pretty large group. This draws a stark contrast to the guild chat described below.


## The Guild

The WoW guild is a smaller group within one's faction. Guilds vary in size, but most consist of around 20 to 40 active members. While it is possible to not be a member of any guild, almost all players belong to one. Each avatar can only belong to one guild. Guilds are entirely player driven, being player named, player moderated, and invite only. Naturally this leads to a large amount of diversity between different "kinds" of guilds. In general, guilds attract the kinds of players that are most like the players already in the guild, and form a kind of club or social network of other players that share common goals or ideas about how the game is best played.

Even more so than factions, guilds are a powerful force in shaping the way social interaction occurs in WoW. Where one feels a certain sense of camaraderie to their faction, that sense is almost always stronger between members of the same guild. In most cases, the members of a guild will be the each other's closest friends in the game, and the majority of objectives that require teamwork and commitment will be organized by the guild. It is not uncommon for members of the same guild to communicate more personally and in a larger number of ways with one another than they would with players belonging to other guilds, which is something we will discuss at length later in the paper.

Since guilds are player driven, there isn't any real limit to the number of types of guilds; however there are two that stand out. PvE (player versus environment) and PvP (player versus player) guilds are the two main types of guilds, and this is because they mirror the main endgame goals of the game. Some guilds do a bit of both, but in general there is a focus on one of the two.

The presentation of different endgame goals that offer similar challenge in an immersive and engaging way is one of the reasons WoW has continued to be so successful a decade after its launch.


### PvE

PvE consists of dungeons and raids, in which a group of some number of players work together to defeat a challenging encounter or series of encounters programmed into the game. This is much like fighting a boss in D&D, where a group of players is tasked with killing a much more powerful enemy.

A PvE guild doing the most challenging content in the game raids with 20 person groups. A large part of the challenge of the content is with organizing and instructing those 20 people. It's very much like a team sport, with defined leaders, respected players, and applicants.

### PvP

PvP consists of specific spaces in the game allotted to allow players to compete against one another. Unlike PvE, a player knows the capabilities of his opponents because they are limited to the skills and spells of their class and specialization. The more casual PvP zones are called battlegrounds, spaces in which teams of 15-40 people compete against one another to complete objectives like capturing the enemy flag or killing the enemy commander. Players can join a battleground by themselves and be added to a team or join with a small group of their friends. Battleground usually reward honor points, which is used to buy entry level PvP equipment. Rated battlegrounds are a more formalized and more competitive form of battlegrounds, in which teams are limited to 10 players and all of the players on the team must join together. Arenas are one of 2v2, 3v3, or 5v5, and are generally considered the most competitive form of PvP. Arenas and rated battlegrounds award conquest points, which are used to purchase higher level PvP gear, and assign players a rating similarly to the way chess players are rated. A player's rating is used to determine the skill of the opponents that they play against, and some PvP rewards are only available to players with a high enough rating. Serious PvP teams can require commitment and practice the same way that serious raid groups do, and there are a lot of parallels in terms of time requirements and dedication to a physical world team sport. 

# Game Interface and Third Party Software

World of Warcraft attempts to give players a truly immersive gameplay experience, a large part of the game’s appeal is the ability for players to become connected to their faction, their race, their class; and to feel that they have an impact on the world as one of its inhabitants. A natural part of this immersion is to give the player the ability to do most of the things that he or she could do as a physical person in that world. It follows naturally that in order to give the players a huge amount of options about what they can do in WoW, the developers needed to come up with a lot of different ways for players to convey their desires into the game. One fantastic example of this is the emote system described in the previous section. In the real world, communication is not limited to only what you can express in English words, but is supplemented by body language, hand gestures, expressions, and so on. In an attempt to make the virtual space in World of Warcraft as “real” as possible, the developers added to the game the ability for a player to control his character’s body language and hand gestures, albeit in a limited manner.

One of the more common complaints about World of Warcraft is that the interface is just too complicated, classes have too many abilities, and there is just too much for a new player to pick up quickly. Serious players, however, know the opposite to be true. The game’s complexity is simply too high to be able to control one’s avatar in a way that is both efficient and subtle. For example, some players find it too cumbersome to type "/wave" every time they want to wave to someone, particularly if their hands are occupied with controlling other facets of their avatar. Taking this idea even further, it would be unreasonable to expect a raid leader to communicate instructions to other members of the raid by typing in the middle of a tough boss fight. For these reasons and others, most players turn to options outside of the game’s default interface to help them communicate in a way that makes the experience more natural, and therefore more immersive.

One way that users supplement the default game interface is with the addition of third party "AddOns". These AddOns are small programs developed by users to run on top of the game’s interface. By conforming to a set of standards that Blizzard designed into the game’s interface, these AddOns mesh seamlessly with the natural interface without requiring Blizzard to make accommodations for specific AddOns. AddOns do just about anything that a user could have thought to write a program to do, from keeping track of damage sources in an encounter to changing the in game font to giving the player warnings when encounter specific events are about to occur; the number of variety of AddOns is staggering.

It is impossible to convey certain things we take for granted in the physical world into a virtual world where text is the only means of communication. Tone and inflection, with the addition that it is simply faster and does not require one’s hands, is the reason that most players use some sort of third party voice over internet protocol (VOIP) program to communicate with their friends in WoW. Examples of these include programs like Ventrillo, TeamSpeak, and Mumble, just to name a few. They are similar to the household program Skype, but they are more advanced in a number of ways. For example, players almost always use some sort of "broadcast" hotkey, which enables their microphone for as long as the key is pushed down, similar to the way a walkie-talkie works. Additionally, players can change the volume that they broadcast at, and the volumes of other users individually. Giving users additional control in ways like these ensures players can manage a single channel (like a Skype call) with as many as 20 people or sometimes even more. Almost all PvE guilds require use of these tools of their active members.

Interviews that were conducted while doing research for this paper were conducted in Ventrillo and Mumble. This makes sense, because the members of our guilds that we interviewed already hang out on the guilds' VOIP clients. Even though the entirety of the interview discussed just the game, it is easier to leverage third party software to communicate than it is to use the game's built in communication methods. Just like in Second Life, it is a matter of contention whether or not Blizzard should incorporate some kind of voice chat into the game's default interface. For many players, using voice chat is as much a matter of social importance as it is convenience. Most players would not want to voice chat with anyone, and reserve that more intimate form of communication for players who they consider their friends. 

For this paper the majority of the information comes directly from the authors' past experience playing WoW, from records of chat logs, and from formal and informal interviews with members of their guilds. Interviews were either transcribed directly as they were conducted, or recorded as a sound file and transcribed later. It was quite interesting to hear players talk about the different reasons they play the game, what they get out of guilds, and things like that. It was also interesting to see how some trends applied to almost everyone who plays WoW. For example, almost all WoW players got into the game because they already had friends who played, and who convinced them to join them. As we progress through this paper we will discuss some of the results of our findings at length.

# The Community of World of Warcraft

World of Warcraft's community is one of the better communities that has built up around a video game. In our experiences, players are for the most part respectful of one another and often willing to help one another. This is likely because the social element of World of Warcraft has serious impact on how effective a player can be in the game, while in other games relationships between players only last the length of one match and players are effectively anonymous. This gives players a reason to be nice to one another, because in World of Warcraft if word gets around that a player is difficult to get along with, that that player can have a hard time finding a guild or getting invited to groups. This also means that players in World of Warcraft are generally more mature than players of other online games. The average male WoW player is around 27, and the average female WoW player is around 32. Again compare this to games like Call of Duty, where the average player is between 16 and 22. This maturity shows in the ability of groups to work together effectively, in the general adherence to the game's social etiquette, and in the relatively small number of griefers and spammers. 

The general trend of maturity in WoW players also shows in the game's demographics, which may also be impacted by the immersive nature of the game and by the hardware and software requirements of the game. Playing World of Warcraft seriously requires a certain level of time commitment, with the average wow player playing somewhere around 20 hours a week. It also requires a computer that can run the game, and the setup and maintanence of dozens of addons and third party softwares. This is very different from a game like Call of Duty, which can be played with just a console and a TV, requires effectively no commitment (as games are drop-in / drop-out style matchmaking, and the world is not persistent), and has little to no social component. The stereotypical Call of Duty player is male, in his teens, and is quick to insult his fellow players, and because of this games like Call of Duty have been getting a lot of flak for being unwelcoming to players who do not fit that stereotype. Compared to games like Call of Duty, where ~16% of the players are female, as much as 25% of World of Warcraft players are female. In general, the authors of this paper have found the community of World of Warcraft to be welcoming of all players willing to work towards their common goal, regardless of things like race, gender, or class. 

WoW etiquette is something that is learned quickly by new players, usually either because someone teaches them or because it is easy to mimic the actions of other players. As mentioned before, most players start playing WoW because someone they already know convinces them to start. This also means that most new players have someone to show them the ropes, and to make sure they know the appropriate ways to interact with other players. For example, it is considered impolite to invite someone to a group without communicating with them first, or to initiate trade with another player without first coming to an agreement about the conditions of the exchange. players that breach etiquette are often "ignored" by other players, which limits their availability to communicate with the player that ignored them. Some breaches of etiquette, such as spamming a global chat channel or being racist or otherwise offensive, can have more serious repurcussions. In the past players have been kicked out of their guilds or even banned from the game by Blizzard for serious breaches of game ettiquette.

# World of Warcraft's Virtual Economy

Not all players are power gamers, and Blizzard ensured during development that even those who played more casually could find places to excel in World of Warcraft. One such example of a more casual oriented endgame is WoW's virtual economy. Blizzard attempted to ensure that the world of Azeroth was as immersive as possible, and one way they contributed to this was by putting the infrastructure in place for players to generate an extensive virtual economy. There are several forms of currency in WoW, and several ways to exchange currencies for items and vice versa. One of the ways the game regulates how quickly a player can progress is by limiting that player’s access to a given currency. Some typical expenses that a player needs to pay for include: 
-	Purchases from vendors, including equipment or consumable items
-	Transportation fees
-	Training fees
-	Repair bills, for when the player’s equipment is damaged
-	Auction house purchases or direct trade with players

For most of these expenses, the currency the player needs is gold, the “money” of WoW. For more advanced purchases, including things like end game gear or trade good exchanges, the player needs some other currency like honor points or raid tokens. People gain wealth in WoW by: 
-	Looting gold from slain enemies
-	Completing quests
-	Selling unneeded or outdated equipment
-	Performing services for other players, such as cutting a gem or crafting an enchantment
-	Auctioning goods or equipment to other players via the Auction House or by informally trading with other players.

In the case of specific currencies like honor points (used for purchasing PvP equipment) or Apexis crystals (used for upgrading PvE equipment), players can win PvP events or complete specific endgame quests, respectively. 

Each avatar in World of Warcraft can have two professions. In most cases players choose a gathering profession, such as mining or herb gathering, and a complementary crafting profession, such as blacksmithing or alchemy. Crafting professions allow a player to craft equipment, potions, or other useful items. In most cases, the items crafted by players can be sold to other players, and so the prices of those items greatly fluctuate depending on the supply and demand in the market. This means that having a lot of gold can give a player access to crafted items that other players cannot yet afford, which is one way that they can translate their virtual wealth to a real in-game advantage over other players. This means that while most players are okay with just having enough gold to get by, some hardcore powergamers consider having an excess of gold to be an essential part of staying ahead of the curve. 

Still other players have no particular reason to amass vast amounts of gold, but consider it a fun challenge to leverage the in game economy and prove that they can make it big. Some players have even been able to create small monopolies on niche corners of the economy, such as a particular trade good. This is possible by monitoring the auction house, which is the primary means of exchanging goods between players, and purchasing the entire supply of that good before re-selling the goods for a higher price. This technique allows a player or group of players to eliminate competition by buying them out of the market.

Since prices of goods can fluctuate so dramatically, one technique many guilds use is to band together within the guild and pool their resources. By doing so, a guild can funnel unneeded resources to a player who can make use of them, and that player can craft equipment or items at a much higher rate than they would be able to if they had to go out and rather all of the resources themself.

## Avatar Presentation

Like many virtual spaces, World of Warcraft presents players with an opportunity to create themselves in a variety of images. Players have the ability to craft their in-game avatar in any number of ways, including choosing race and gender, which may or may not reflect their actual physical appearance. Wagner James Au reports on Second Life and other virtual worlds for a publication called New World Notes, and many of his observations about avatar presentation in Second Life apply to World of Warcraft. For example, he write that in Second Life a player’s control over the appearance of their avatar allows them to present themselves to other players in whatever way they choose. This essentially lets a player decide which preconceptions they want other players to have of them, which can be quite empowering when people are using to dealing with negative preconceptions in the physical world. 

To a lesser extent this occurs in World of Warcraft as well. What race and gender a player chooses for their avatar can tell you a lot about them, some people choose to make themselves look as impressive or cool as possible in game, while others attempt to shock or disgust other players by making themselves as strange looking as possible. Why a player chooses a particular appearance can also tell you a lot about them. For example, if a player chooses to play a Troll because Trolls have a slightly higher chance to critically hit than other races, they are likely a power gamer who cares more about achieving results than role playing. Along the same vein, if a player refuses to play a gnome because gnomes look silly -- even when gnomes are the best race for their class -- then they probably place more weight on their characters appearance than on some small advantage. 

Avatar presentation is an interesting topic in any virtual world. The fact that avatars are less customizable in WoW than in other virtual worlds means fewer players really think about what their avatar might say about them. While some players we interviewed said that their character’s appearance followed some kind of role playing theme, many also said that avatar appearance mattered very little. Still, it is safe to say that in some cases avatar presentation plays a role in social interactions in WoW. Many players consider Gnomes and Goblins to be “annoying” and are negatively predisposed towards players of those races. Regardless, the fact that avatars are customizable and do not necessarily reflect your physical appearance allows relationships to be built in World of Warcraft that might never have gotten off the ground in the physical world because of negative preconceptions based on appearance. Avatar customizability contributes to the general sense of accessibility in World of Warcraft, where the biases associated with race and gender can be subverted by simply changing the appearance of an avatar. 

## Accessibility

As metioned earlier in the paper, one of the things that makes WoW appealing to serious gamers is the general sense of maturity in its playerbase. World of Warcraft is a space in which a player's avatar is not tied in any way to who that player is in the physical world. This means that in some cases WoW offers an opportunity for a player to overcome physical world limitations and level the playing field between him/herself and the other players. For example, female players in WoW can role play a male character and play without any of the bias that they encounter as a woman in the real world. The same is true for minorities and people with disabilities; no-one in WoW is going to care if you are balding or what clothes you wear, because those factors have no impact on your ability to excel in the game. In some cases, WoW even offers an opportunity for players with disabilities to ignore the things that usually impact every aspect of their life. For example, a person who cannot walk has the same capabilities as every other player in the virtual world of Azeroth. There is one woman in BearBlasting who is deaf, and World of Warcraft offers her a space in which she can play as an equal and not feel handicapped by her disability. There are countless examples such as these, which together show that World of Warcraft can be a truely unique space that provides opportunities that the physical world might never accomodate.
