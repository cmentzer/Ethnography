Introduction

Blizzard Entertainment launched World of Warcraft in late 2004, as the latest installment of the Warcraft real time strategy games from the 1990’s. The game was immediately something of a phenomenon in the gaming community, and today it is an icon of nerd and gamer culture around the world. Odds are good that you’ve heard of it. 

The authors of this paper, Nate Lilianthal and Clayton Mentzer, have been World of Warcraft players for a number of years, and between them have seen first-hand a lot of what the game has to offer. The intent of this paper is to call into question some of the stereotypes about World of Warcraft players, dispel some of the persistent misconceptions about the game and the world that it contains, and to investigate the differences between relationships that are formed in the context of WoW’s virtual space and those that are formed in the physical world. It is our belief that there is a lot of misinformation out there about World of Warcraft, the people that play WoW, and the virtual spaces have the capacity to generate interpersonal relationships that are as meaningful as those created in the physical world. But first: 

What is World of Warcraft?

World of Warcraft is a massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG), or often just MMO for short. There have been a lot of MMOs that have been developed since WoW’s release, and a lot of people would argue that WoW isn’t as good as some of the newer ones. Nevertheless, WoW remains the most popular MMO on the market today, with upwards of 10 million active subscribers and 100 million different accounts created over its lifetime. In terms of man-hours, World of Warcraft players have invested nearly 6 million years of time into the game. WoW dwarfs every other MMO in terms of active player base, and while many people are just waiting for the MMO that “kills WoW”, none of them so far have gotten it quite right the way WoW has.

One of the reasons World of Warcraft has been so successful is that its roots go deep. The game draws inspiration from a myriad of sources that have all built upon one another back through the histories of gaming and fantasy, and almost all those sources have been quite successful. Perhaps one of the oldest lines that one can trace back from WoW leads to J. R.. R. Tolkien, and his The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Almost all fantasy work today draws heavily upon Tolkien’s work; which should be little surprise considering how widely loved his novels were, and are today. WoW’s lore is extremely reminiscent of Tolkien’s work: The world is filled with fantastic places and races, each of with their own histories and cultures, and all of which contain a little magic. 

By creating a world with as much depth and complexity as Tolkien’s Middle Earth, Blizzard ensured their world would be as immersive to their players as possible. Having a vast and complex world isn’t always a good thing, however. One of the common complaints about other MMOs is that the world is just too hard to get immersed in. It is too foreign or there is too much lore for a player to catch up on, or perhaps the lore is all presented to the player too quickly or too slowly. This leads us to a second reason WoW has been so successful: it built upon a franchise that the players already loved. The Warcraft Strategy games from the 1990’s had a large following prior to even the announcement of WoW, and Blizzard was able to leverage the fact that there were already characters and places and events that players of the Warcraft RTS games were familiar with when they were designing WoW. This meant that when WoW released and players loaded up the game for the first time, they already had feelings of nostalgia about the game. We know today looking at all the indie remakes of classic games how powerful the nostalgia factor can be when playing a game, and Blizzard hit metaphorical video game design gold when they decided to throw their players into a world that they had already played in, and that they were able to immediately mesh with. 

In the same way many WoW players came to the game with some pre-existing knowledge of the game’s world and lore, many WoW players came to the game with some pre-existing knowledge of the gameplay mechanics. Just as Blizzard drew heavily from fantasy sources and its own Warcraft RTS franchise when creating the world, they drew heavily from games like Baldur’s Gate and Dungeons and Dragons when designing the gameplay. Because of this, players who were already familiar with the mechanics of games like Baldur’s Gate and D&D immediately meshed with the gameplay of WoW. Your avatar in game has a race and class; an inventory; some set of skills or magical knowledge; and combat is at least partially randomized based on virtual dice rolls. The game is designed around a quest / reward system, where you complete some series of tasks for a non-player-character (a character in the game not controlled by a player, an NPC), and that NPC rewards you for your effort with some kind of loot. All of these ideas are drawn directly from Dungeons and Dragons, and by taking these ideas from D&D Blizzard brought a lot of D&D fans into WoW. With them came some of the social stigmas associated with D&D players, as well as the kind of hardcore dedicated fan that could spend 6 hours a night 3 or more days of the week playing the game. 
	There are two main social constructions in World of Warcraft: The first is the faction that your avatar belongs to, and the second is the guild that your avatar is a member of. While there are of course other social factors that play into the way players interact with one another, these are the most restricting ones built into the game. The reason factions play such an important role in social interaction is simple: you cannot communicate via text with members of the other faction. This leads to some interesting scenarios when one player runs into a member of the other faction, particularly on a PvP server where players of opposing factions can directly harm one another, because it is impossible for you to engage the other player in conversation. Instead, players are limited to the in game “emote” system, which allows you to express yourself with a number of limited physical gestures. For example, it is common practice to show a player of the other faction that one means them no harm by “waving” at them. By typing /wave into the chat window, a player can cause their avatar to wave at someone else. There are a number of emotes built into the game, but naturally it is impossible to use them alone to convey advanced ideas. The inability to communicate with members of the opposite faction is one of the many contributors to a general feeling of camaraderie that members of one faction share. It also contributes to negative feelings about members of the opposite faction; it is not uncommon for an Alliance player to justify griefing a Horde player by simply saying that they are Horde, so they deserve it. Inability to communicate cross faction makes it easier to dehumanize members of the opposite faction, and to treat them in ways that would be unacceptable in the physical world. Cross faction relationships are an interesting topic, and we will discuss it at length later in the paper. 
	The second main social construct in World of Warcraft is Guilds. While it is possible to not be a member of any guild, almost all players belong to one. Each avatar can only belong to one guild. Guilds are entirely player driven. They are player named, player moderated, and invite only. Naturally this leads to a large amount of diversity between different “kinds” of guilds. In general, guilds attract the kinds of players that are most like the players already in the guild, and form a kind of club or social network of other players that share common goals or ideas about how the game is best played. Even more so than factions, Guilds are a powerful force in shaping the way social interaction occurs in World of Warcraft. Where one feels a certain sense of camaraderie to their faction, that sense is almost always stronger between members of the same guild. In most cases, the members of a guild will be one others’ closest friends in the game, and the majority of objectives that require teamwork and commitment will be at least organized by one guild. It is not uncommon for members of the same guild to communicate more personally and in a larger number of ways with one another than they would with players belonging to other guilds, which is something we will discuss at length later in the paper. 
	It is generally accepted that there are two main endgame goals in World of Warcraft: Player versus Environment (PvE) and Player versus Player (PvP). While there are certainly people who play the game with other goals in mind and whose PvE or PvP experience is very limited, the majority of players fall into one of the two (or both) of these goals. Each of these endgame goals will have a large section of the body of the paper dedicated to it, so we won’t get too much into them now. In short, PvE consists of dungeons and raids, in which a group of some number of players work together to defeat a challenging encounter or series of encounters programmed into the game. PvP consists of specific spaces in the game allotted to allow players to compete against one another, which makes them challenging in a different way. The presentation of different endgame goals that offer similar challenge in an immersive and engaging way is one of the reasons WoW has continued to be so successful a decade after its launch.
