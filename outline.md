# Outline for Ethnography Paper

From the assignment description,

> What does the space look like? How is it organized? What are people doing? How do people interact? What is the culture of the space? What are the social roles and norms? What is the etiquette? In addition, you should try to observe some of the themes addressed in the course: how people build virtual communities; the nature of on-line identity; gender, racial, and class differences; how people use the Internet for political purposes, etc. Think of yourself as an on-line explorer learning about new peoples and cultures in an emerging virtual universe.

> If you choose to write a paper it should be 10-15 pages double spaced and written in 12 pt. font (roughly 4,500 to 6,750 words). You are encouraged to be creative in your narrative format and style (write in the first person, tell a story, etc.), but all papers/projects should include:

- An Introduction that lays out where the discussion is going and the main points
    - The thread of the paper is to draw parallels between the culture of WoW and RL. Focusing on how for example raiding might be like a team sport, guilds can be like social cliques, etc.
- An explanation of the research site and why the topic was selected
    - The interface the player has with the world, and the surrounding community. Touch on Chat, Emotes, VoIP, and forums/websites, etc.
- Some reflexive discussion of your own background and how that might influence your research, as well as a description of the methods used, including information about your informants (those you observed or interviewed)
    - Both of us will use a page or two here to give a complete and concise history of our time in WoW. This includes primarily: why we play, who we play with, and what our goals are.
- Three to four sections, each separated by a heading, that elucidate your main points—how cultural values, social norms, and/or other themes from the course are expressed in your research site. Each section should include data from your observations or interviews and summarize the material to make a point. You should try to analyze that data as much as possible using frameworks, theories, and analyses from the course.
	1. Game community
	2. Guilds
	3. Power gamers
	4. Economy
- A conclusion that ties the various points or themes together.

- In writing your paper or completing your project, you should make at least four explicit connections to readings from the class (properly cited). Outside readings can also be used, but they are not required.
	- This shouldn’t be too hard. The SL and WoW readings should have plenty of ideas that we can tie back to, and if we really want we could probably tie into it the idea of anonymity and what changes arise due to the inability to communicate cross-faction.

## Structure

1. Introduction
	- Who we are and why we chose to conduct this ethnography.
    - What is the World of Warcraft?
    - Explaining the thread of the paper, which is to draw parallels between the culture of WoW and RL. Focusing on how for example raiding might be like a team sport, guilds can be like social cliques, etc.
2. WoW Background
    - Overview
    - Guilds
    - PvE
    - PvP
3. Methods
	- Brief discussion of the interface that the game provides players.
    - Discussion of means of communication, and why players so often turn to communication options outside the game’s natural UI, like VoIP.
    - Overview of the interview process, as well as an explanation of the way we observe the things happening in WoW and tie them back into the paper.
4. Our Experiences
	- A comparison by example of the culture of your guild and mine, and the differences between our goals in the game, including:
    	- Casual “for fun” stance vs goal oriented progression raiding
    	- Family and irl friends vs application and merit based membership
    	- Note, these views should be presented separately, it's up to the reader to draw most of the connections. Basically I want to avoid making too many direct reference to each others experience. It will be less redundant this way.
5.  Main Points
    - Game community
    - Guilds
    - Power gamers
    - Economy
	- cultural issues within the game *tentative*
    	- Avatar presentation, including race and gender
        - Accessibility of the game to real world minorities, including perhaps a discussion of how WoW is an area where people can excel in ways that they could not in the real world due to physical disabilities or whatever, also gender
        - Griefing and camping
        - Anonymity
6. Conclusion
